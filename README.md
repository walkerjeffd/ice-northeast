## About

This repository contains the source code for the Interactive Catchment Explorer (ICE) application of Stream Temperature and Brook Trout Occupancy in the Northeast U.S.

If you are interested in using ICE to explore other datasets, please see the ICE starter template [walkerjeffd/ice-template](https://github.com/walkerjeffd/ice-template), which contains the latest design and implementation of ICE and includes more detailed developer instructions.

## Datasets

The R and bash scripts located in the `scripts` folder are used to generate the datasets for this application, which get saved to the `data/` folder. See `scripts/README.md` for instructions. Note this requires access to the SHEDS database.

Due to their large size, the generated datasets are **not** stored in this repo. To get the latest version of the datasets, download the following tarball and extract it to the `data/` folder.

```
wget https://ecosheds.org/data/ice-northeast/ice-northeast-data.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ice-northeast-data.tar.gz -C ./data
```

## Project setup

Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

Configuration is set using `.env` files for each environment (`development`, `staging`, `production`). See [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html) for details.

There are two required configuration variables:

```
BASE_URL=/ # root path for the application
VUE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/  # location for fetching data, set to baseURL for axios
```

The default `.env` files can be overriden with `.local` variants (e.g. `.env.development.local`).

## Development Server

To run the application in development mode, run the `dev` command, which serves the `data/` folder at port `8000`, and runs the vue CLI `serve` command.

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Production Build

Run the `build` command to build the application for production. The output is saved to the `dist/` folder.

```sh
yarn build
```

For staging build, run `build:staging`

```sh
yarn build:staging
```

## Deployment

After building the application, copy the contents of `dist/` and `data/` to the production server.

```sh
rsync -av --delete dist/ user@host:/path/to/app
rsync -av --delete data/ user@host:/path/to/data
```

If the application is deployed to S3, use the AWS CLI.

```sh
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://<WEBSITE_BUCKET_NAME>/<BASE_URL> --delete
aws s3 sync data/ s3://<DATA_BUCKET_NAME>/ --delete
```
